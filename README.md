# PongPrototype
 This is a Prototype of Pong for SDEV 265 System Software Analysis.
 
 # Description
 The program executes initially via "menu.py," which offers the user three different choices: Play the game, register players, or continue to the customization menu. Choosing "Play" without going to the customization menu or registering any players will start a default version of Pong. Registering players will allow users to input their player name and to choose a color for their paddle. The customization menu offers multiple custom gameplay options, including: game mode, rotating paddles, ball color, and number of balls in play. The available game modes are: Standard, 2-Player Rally, 1-Player Rally, and 2-Player Free Play.

 # Installation
 The program can be downloaded via GitHub. From there, users must execute the "menu.py" file, which will begin the processes for the game and game customization. 

 # Dependencies
 The program requires both Tkinter and Pygame libraries to function. It has not been tested on an OS other than Windows and, therefore, cannot be guaranteed to run on such.

 # Authors and acknowledgement
 This program was created by Brenden Melody, Darcy Ralstin, and Cailli Church. Brenden was the main programmer and handled the bulk of the code, while Cailli handled documentation, and Darcy worked on both where needed.
